## Test Protocol

### Phase 1: Basic Sync Verification

#### Test 1.1: Initial Sync Setup
**Objective**: Verify basic sync functionality works between devices

**Steps**:
1. **On Device A**:
   - Install extension
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Sync tab
   - Note "Last Successful Sync" status (should be "Never")
   - Add test websites to deny list:
     - `test-site-1.com`
     - `test-site-2.com`
     - `example-blocking.net`
   - Save settings
   - Check "Last Successful Sync" timestamp

2. **On Device B**:
   - Install extension (wait 2-3 minutes for auto-sync)
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Sync tab
   - Click "Refresh Rules from Cloud"
   - Verify deny list contains same websites
   - Check "Last Successful Sync" timestamp

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Device B receives all websites from Device A

     - `allowed-site-1.com`
     - `trusted-domain.org`
   - Add keywords to deny list:
     - `advertisement`
     - `tracking`
   - Save settings

2. **On Device A**:

   - Make a small change (add one website to deny list)
   - Save settings
   - Immediately check sync status

2. **Verification**:
   - "Last Successful Sync" timestamp should update
   - "Sync Health" should remain "Good"
   - "Consecutive Errors" should be 0 or not displayed

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Timestamp updates within 5 seconds of save
- ‚úÖ Sync health remains positive
- ‚úÖ No error indicators shown

#### Test 2.2: Error Tracking
**Objective**: Verify sync errors are properly tracked and displayed

**Steps**:

   - Save settings (this should fail)
   - Repeat 2-3 times to generate consecutive errors

2. **Verification**:
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Sync tab
   - Check "Recent Sync Errors" section
   - Check "Consecutive Errors" count
   - Check "Sync Health" status

3. **Recovery**:
   - Reconnect to internet
   - Click "Force Sync Settings"
   - Verify error count resets

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Errors appear in "Recent Sync Errors"
- ‚úÖ "Consecutive Errors" count increases

   - Reconnect both devices

2. **Resolution**:
   - Wait for automatic sync
   - Manually trigger "Refresh Rules from Cloud" if needed
   - Check final state on both devices

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Both websites appear in final deny list
- ‚úÖ No data loss occurs
- ‚úÖ Both devices show consistent state
