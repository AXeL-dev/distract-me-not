# Service Worker Storage Fix Summary

## Problem
The Distract-Me-Not extension's service worker was failing to load blacklist/whitelist patterns from Chrome sync storage into memory on startup, causing the extension to allow all websites instead of blocking according to configured rules.

## Root Cause
The issue was with the `chrome.storage.sync.get()` API call using async/await pattern in the service worker context. While the storage contained the correct data (verified by sync diagnostics), the main initialization function was receiving null/undefined results from storage reads.

## Solution
Replaced the async/await storage access pattern with Promise-wrapped callback pattern for all storage operations in the service worker initialization:

### Before (Failing):
```javascript
const items = await chrome.storage.sync.get(syncSettings);
```

### After (Working):
```javascript
const items = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  chrome.storage.sync.get(syncSettings, (result) => {
    if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
      reject(new Error(chrome.runtime.lastError.message || 'Storage error'));
    } else {
      resolve(result || {});
    }
  });
});
```

## Files Modified
- `public/service-worker.js` - Main service worker initialization fix
- `build/service-worker.js` - Build version with same fix applied

## Changes Made
1. **Fixed storage access pattern**: Changed from async/await to Promise-wrapped callbacks
2. **Added proper error handling**: Include chrome.runtime.lastError checks
3. **Applied to all storage calls**: Both sync and local storage access in init function
4. **Robust fallback logic**: Maintained existing fallback to local storage
5. **Added storage constants**: Defined syncSettings and localSettings arrays at top level

## Verification
- Extension now loads blacklist/whitelist data into memory on startup
- Blocking works immediately after extension reload (no manual patches needed)
- Reddit.com/* patterns and other wildcard rules function correctly
- Storage diagnostics show data loads successfully

## Testing
The fix was extensively tested with:
- Pattern matching verification
- Storage access validation  
- Extension reload testing
- Real-world blocking scenarios (reddit.com, facebook.com, etc.)

## Cleanup
All debugging and test files created during troubleshooting have been removed to keep the repository clean for PR submission.

**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED** - Extension blocking functionality fully restored
