TODO
====

- when disabling status the overlay should be removed from all tabs + when enabling status the current tab should be checked.
- the same thing when changing mode to blacklist or whitelist.
- the same thing again, when adding a website to black or white list from panel.
- in mode option, click on blacklist or whitelist while it's already checked should be ignored.
- add a 'Give UP' button in the overlayer (to disable blocking).
- check compatibility with chrome.
- better code quality & documentation.
