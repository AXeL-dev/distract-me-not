- better UI (use font-awesome for icons)?
- add an option to schedule time.
- add redirect to url option.
- possibility to modify an existing url in settings (instead of delete it & create a new one).
- show a confirm popup when switching status off?
- add a 'Give UP' button in the overlayer (to disable blocking)?
- better code quality & documentation.
